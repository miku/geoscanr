# geoscanr

A custom fetcher for geoscan data.

* fetch sitemap (https://geoscan.nrcan.gc.ca/googlesitemapGCxml.xml)
* fetch all links, extract data
* cache html locally
* fetch linked assets, maybe
* create complete set in a single file

We do not need incremental updates, because we can use RSS for that.
