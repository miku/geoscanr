# geoscanr

A custom fetcher for geoscan data.

* [x] fetch sitemap (https://geoscan.nrcan.gc.ca/googlesitemapGCxml.xml)
* [x] fetch all links, extract data
* [x] cache html locally
* [ ] fetch linked assets, maybe
* [ ] create complete set in a single file

We do not need incremental updates, because we can use RSS for that.
